I research the history of Bitcoin, the life and works of Sir George Makgill, and Operation Atlantis—an attempt at building a startup private city according to Objectivist principles—and in 2020 I launched the [Operation Atlantis Digital Archive](https://operationatlantis.ch) based on primary source material that had been missing for nearly 60 years.

## About the site

This URL has been my online home for many years, manifesting at times as a blog or a portfolio until landing on this current single-column blog. Today it’s a bit of an outlet graveyard for my design-and development-related ramblings.

In case you were wondering, this site is:

- Designed and coded on a Mac in California
- Coded with Atom
- Built on Jekyll, the open source static site generator
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

You can find more about my macOS development setup in my config repo on GitHub. The design and code powering this site, however, is not available for re-use or purchase.
